# Clusterize

<p>1. The code initializes examples and initial seeds for k-means clustering with three clusters in two dimensions.</p>
<p>2. It performs one iteration (epoch) of the k-means algorithm, calculating Euclidean distances between examples and current centroids.</p>
<p>3. Based on the distances, it assigns each example to the cluster with the nearest centroid.</p>
<p>4. It updates the centroids to the mean of points in their respective clusters.</p>
Finally, the code visualizes the clusters and centroids after the first epoch using matplotlib.
